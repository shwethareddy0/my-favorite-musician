      <strong>Taylor Alison Swift</strong> (born December 13, 1989) is an

      pursue a career in country music.

      With over 200 million records sold worldwide, Swift is one of the
      best-selling musicians of all time. Eight of her songs have topped the Hot
      100, and her concert tours are some of the highest-grossing in history.
